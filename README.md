**Fourth Assignment: Creating a quiz using Javascript**
This was a difficult assignment that I still have not fully figured out. The idea is to build, from scratch, a page that utilizes Javascript 
to create a quiz about general coding. Included within is a thirty-second timer, a start button to commence the quiz itself, a form to input a
user's initials to go with their highscore at the end of the quiz, along with a submit button, a link to the highscores, a "Clear" button which 
gives the option to clear all highscores and a "Return to Quiz" button.
